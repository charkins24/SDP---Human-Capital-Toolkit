##               a teacher is in the data.  This will:                                           ##

  # This is from page 57 of 'SDP_Data_Building_Tasks_HC_12_18_2013.pdf'.
  #   I did not understand the purpose of this code, which made it difficult for me to think about
  #   how to replicate it in R.  When comparing dates for the hire and terminiation fields
  #   in my file at this point to the SDP clean file there were no differences where data existed.
  #   The differences were in null terminiation dates being populated in the SDP file, yet there 
  #   were still tens of thousands of null dates. Also where terminiation dates were populated,
  #   they were filled in with dates prior to the hire date.  
  #   Perhaps I'll revisit once I see how these files will be used later in the analysis.
  
   
# Merge the temporary file with cleaned school codes to current file. -------------------------
